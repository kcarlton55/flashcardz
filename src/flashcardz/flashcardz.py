A simple flashcards program used to, among other things, learn another
language.  Flash cards are saved in a local file.  The file has the form:

word1 | definition1 | date | viewed | tally
word2 | definition2 | date | viewed | tally
           ...
wordN | definitionN | date | viewed | tally

Date is the date that a particular card was created.  Viewed is the number of
times that the card has been viewed.  Tally is the number of times the user
correctly knew the definition of a word without a miss. Tally is reset to zero
anytime the user did not rememember the definition.

Once the maximum tally value has been reached (default is 10), the word is
removed from the card set.  To run the program, run the go() function.
The go() function shuffles the cards before presenting cards to the user.

This program is meant to be run using python's interactive command-line
terminal (i.e. read-eval-print loop (REPL) terminal).  This comes standard when
python is installed on your PC.

    Parameters
    ----------
    word : string
        New word to add to the deck of cards.  (A string is text surrounded
        by quotation marks, e.g. "house (noun)"; though triple quotes make
        working with the comannd line window easier, i.e. """house (noun)""")
    definition : string
        Definition of the word.  Surround your string (i.e. text) with
        quotation marks.  If your string is multiline, surround your string by
        triple quotes, e.g.:
        """ a building that serves as living quarters for one or a few
        families; a shelter, refuge."""

        URL links can be included within a description.  URL links must have
        the form [some text](a url).  For example, a description may look like:

        blah [John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203%3A16&version=NKJV)

        URL links (see add() function) can exists in the description field of
        for a given word.  If so, then i represents the 1st, 2nd, etc. link.
        Entering that number will cause a web browser to open that link.

def go(shuffle=True):
    '''
    First the deck of cards in shuffled.  Then one by one each card is shown
    to the user.  First the word is shown.  The user looks at the word and
    tries to figure out what the word means.  Then the user hits any key.
    The defintion is then shown.  The user is asked if he/she knew what the
    word meant.  If he/she answere yes, then the tally is incremented
    by one.  (Tally is the number of times the user knew what the word means.)
    If the user didn't know, the the tally for that word is reset to zero
    (or another value defined in the program's settings).

    Once a max tally is reached (determined by the program's settings), the
    card is removed from the deck.

    When go() is run, the file that contains the card deck is opened.  After
    all the cards are viewed by the user, the updated card deck is saved.  If
    the user aborts before go() is finished, results are not saved.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shuffle : bool, optional
        Shuffle the deck. The default is True.

    Examples
    --------
    # Don't shuffle the deck (False or 0 results in a non-suffle)
    >>> go(False)

    # Shuffle the deck (True or 1, or enter no argument)
